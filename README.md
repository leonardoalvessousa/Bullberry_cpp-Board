# ðŸ“˜ Project: Bullberry_cpp Board

This project consists of an **educational printed circuit board (PCB)** that combines two widely used technologies in the Internet of Things (IoT): **Wi-Fi** and **LoRa**. It was developed as a didactic tool for teaching, experimentation, and prototyping, targeting both beginners and more advanced users.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Facilitate the learning of **wireless connectivity** with a focus on **IoT**.
- Provide a platform that supports both **Wi-Fi (ESP8266)** and **LoRa (Ra-02)** on a single hardware board.
- Serve as a foundation for tutorials, workshops, and field testing.
- Comply with good design practices using EasyEDA Pro (v2.2.39).
